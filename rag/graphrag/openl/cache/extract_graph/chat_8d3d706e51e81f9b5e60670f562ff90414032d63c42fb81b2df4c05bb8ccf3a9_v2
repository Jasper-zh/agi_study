Buying construction insurance can protect workers and reduce the construction company's compensation burden.\"\n\nFrom this, I can identify entities like 工程师 (construction workers), 保险 (insurance), and 施工单位 (construction company). The relationships here are between 工程师 and 保险 because buying insurance helps them, and 工程师 also have a relationship with 施工单位 since they work under the company.\n\nNext part: \"安监局要求购买建工意外险等保险产品才允许进场施工。这是合规要求，确保施工过程中的安全和风险管理。\" Translates to \"The safety inspection authority requires construction companies to purchase insurance products like construction liability insurance before allowing workers to start construction. This is a compliance requirement to ensure safety and risk management during construction.\"\n\nHere, the entities are 安监局 (SA), 建工意外险 (construction accident insurance), and 建筑公司 (construction company). The relationships include 安监局 requiring 建工意外险 for 建筑公司 to enter the construction site. Also, 建工意外险 helps protect both 工程师 and 施工单位.\n\nPutting it all together, I have identified four entities: 工程师 (person), 保险 (organization), 施工单位 (organization), 安监局 (organization).

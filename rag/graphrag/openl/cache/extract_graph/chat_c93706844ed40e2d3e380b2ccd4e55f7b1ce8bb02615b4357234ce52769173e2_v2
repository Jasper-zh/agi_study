Then, find relationships between them.\n\nFirst, looking at the text:\n\n\"伤害医疗：0.5-10万元\"\nThis translates to \"Damage compensation: 0.5-10 ten thousand yuan.\" So, it's about compensation for damage or injury.\n\nNext:\n•\t意外住院津贴：0-150元/天\nThis is \"Accident hospital benefits: 0-150 yuan per day.\"\n\nThen:\n•\t疾病保障\nWhich means \"Disease coverage\" or maybe \"Health insurance.\"\n\nFurther down:\n•\t疾病（含猝死）身故：0-20万元\nThis translates to \"Disease (including sudden death) death compensation: 0-20 ten thousand yuan.\"\n\nSimilarly:\n•\t交通意外\nWhich is \"Traffic accidents\"\n\nAnd then several sections about different types of traffic accidents and their respective compensation limits.\n\nSo, the entities here are likely:\n\n1. **事件（Event）**: 交通意外 (Traffic Accidents) - since there are multiple types like car, train, plane, etc.\n2. **疾病保障 (Health Insurance)**: This seems to be a service offered by an organization or provider.\n3. **伤害医疗 (Damage Compensation)**: Another type of compensation provided.\n\nNow, for the relationships:\n\n- 事件（Event）交通意外 is related to 疾病保障 because health insurance might cover medical expenses from accidents.\n- Similarly, 事件（Event）疾病身故 relates to 疾病保障 as it's part of the disease coverage.\n- The different types of traffic accident events (like car, train) would all be under the broader 事件（Event）交通意外.\n\nI think that's the main structure.
